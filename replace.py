#This code was used the 'replace' and '.upper()' functions to rewrite the sentence.
sentence = "The!quick!brown!fox!jumps!over!the!lazy!dog."
# Replace "!" with blank space
modified_sentence1 = sentence.replace("!", " ")
# Replace "!" with upper case
modified_sentence2 = sentence.replace("!", " ").upper()
print(modified_sentence1)
print(modified_sentence2)

#Output:
##The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
#THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.
